As a Data Analyst, I successfully applied my skills in SQL, Tableau, Python, and IBM Cognos Analytics to deliver accurate and reliable insights for various business needs. I have demonstrated end-to-end ownership of Tableau dashboards, ensuring data quality, design, and utilization by cross-functional teams. I have also leveraged SQL scripting to verify and report data, addressing ad hoc requests swiftly and effectively.

I recently graduated from Humber College with a post-graduate degree in Business Insights and Analytics, where I learned new concepts relevant to data science. I am looking for a full-time role as a Data Scientist or Data Analyst, where I can contribute to the growth and success of the organization with my passion and expertise in the subjects.
